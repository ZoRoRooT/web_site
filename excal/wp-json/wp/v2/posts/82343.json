Do you understand the security risks posed to your business by using old technology and an old operating system?<\/p>\n<h3>Have you put off your Windows upgrade?<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re way past due \u2014 all support for Windows 7 and Server 2008 ended on January 14, 2020. This means that Microsoft hasn\u2019t offered patches or security updates for Windows 7 (which you need) for over a year and half.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Is This Important To Windows 7 Users?<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to procrastinate on technology upgrades. The process can be expensive and complicated, but the fact is that there comes a point in the technology life cycle when failing to upgrade can present a number of serious concerns.<\/p>\n<p>As important as cost control is, it is equally important to ensure you&#8217;re maintaining your competitive edge, using secure technology, and working as efficiently and effectively as possible.<\/p>\n<p>The primary concern with the end of support for any software (but especially something as critical as an operating system like Windows 7) is that there are no further security patches or updates, which can have dangerous effects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Your computers could be infected by malware,<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Your antivirus is out of date,<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Your online banking transaction protection may expire, and<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Your financial data could be exposed to theft.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What Should Windows 7 Users Do?<\/h3>\n<p>You should begin your upgrade to Windows 10 as quickly as possible on all of your workstations. Upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Makes computers run smoother and faster.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Provides a more economical use of memory and disk space.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Improves security.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Boots up your computer from sleep mode faster than before.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Provides many other benefits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With Windows 10&#8217;s new application programming interface called Windows RunTime, your Windows Store Apps are remotely installed and updated. They can also be cleanly uninstalled.<\/p>\n<p>There are RunTime apps for Mail, Photos, Maps, Calendar, Groove Music, and more. And you can easily download any of the 700,000 applications from the Windows Store.<\/p>\n<h3>Do You Need New Hardware?<\/h3>\n<p>If your computer is 3 &#8211; 5 years old, and running Windows 7, in most cases it makes sense to get a new one.<\/p>\n<p>For most Windows 7 users, moving to a new device with a Windows 10 operating system is the best path forward. Today&#8217;s PCs are faster, lighter in weight, more powerful, and provide increased security.<\/p>\n<h3>What Do You Need To Know About Windows 10 Migration?<\/h3>\n<p>Although Microsoft offers automated systems migration capabilities, you shouldn\u2019t just migrate your systems without any forethought or strategy. There are a few points to consider first:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Business Software Compatibility: If you\u2019re using older line of business software, you may be concerned about how compatible they are with newer operating systems. That\u2019s why Microsoft has developed a range of services to help mitigate those compatibility problems. Most of the software you\u2019re currently using can still be supported on a new operating system \u2014 but make sure to check and find out for sure.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Migration Planning: You may also be worried about how your users will be impacted by the migration. Even a few hours of downtime can be detrimental to your organization\u2019s productivity. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to execute migrations during the evening and after hours. That way, your staff leaves one day having used Windows 7, and comes back the next day to start using Windows 10.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Hardware Requirements: Just like software, it\u2019s important to check that your current hardware is compatible with the most current Windows Operating System (Windows 10). This means checking:\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">The space on your solid-state drive or hard drive.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">The RAM or memory requirements.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">The CPU or Processor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That said, most systems bought within the last five years should be capable of running Windows 10. You won&#8217;t necessarily need cutting-edge hardware to make this operating system work.<\/p>\n<p>If your hardware doesn\u2019t meet the requirements, it may be best to purchase a new machine with Windows 10 installed. Then you can reinstall any current applications that you require.<\/p>\n<h3>Need Expert Assistance With Your Upgrade?<\/h3>\n<p>Before you start, you should figure out if you can handle the migration on your own. There\u2019s no shame in needing help. Especially when it\u2019s a matter of migrating all your apps, data, and other IT assets to a totally new environment.<\/p>\n<p>ExcalTech can help.
